What is this course about? 
Summary of the course Welcome   to   Integrative   Management   (152.399).   This   is   a   collaborative   capstone   course   that   requires students to demonstrate the ability to apply theory and practice to complex   organisational      problems.      The      main      aim      of      this      course      is      for      students      to      develop      and   demonstrate their   understanding of   problem   definition and problem-solving.   This   is   achieved   by   drawing   on   what   you    have    learned   from   the    different    courses,    majors    and   the    broader   knowledge base that   you have. The majors       within       the       School       are         human         resources   management/employment relations,   management, international    business,    information   systems,   and   entrepreneurship/innovation.   Because   of   the   prerequisites   for   enrolment   in   this   course,   you   will    have    prior    knowledge    relating    to    current    issues,   theories,    and    frameworks   relating to your selected   major.A   significant   part of this   course   requires you to work   in teams to    provide    meaningful    advice   to   a real New Zealand business. We also offer several formative feedback points over the semester   to   develop your teamwork skills and   reflective learning. The four assignments are   linked   to one   another    -      please    take    the time to think about how to best use them for your overall   understanding of the course. The assignments    will    be   released    in    week two.The   world   around   us   is   changing at   a   rapid   pace.   Hence,   this   course   is   also   dynamic   by   design,   which   may   mean that we will   not   adhere strictly to the chronological   plan. The course will    have   a   range of guest speakers. The information in this outline   overviews the   course;   we   will   provide   much   more   detail   in   class   over   the semester.   We   wish   you   well   for   your   studies   this   semester   and   look forward to seeing   you   in class   and   online.

Collaborative Assignments 
Part of the assessment for this course   will   involve   working   collaboratively   with   other   students         in   a group or team.    While working collaboratively comes with   challenges,   it   has   many   benefits, including   not only the division   of workload,   but the sharing   of   diverse   skillsets,   areas   of knowledge, and   perspectives. When supporting one   another to value   and   respect   what   each         individual   brings, this   process can   enhance the quality of the final   product   and the   learning   of   every   participant. 
We   recognise that collaborative work can sometimes   be challenging (especially when   you   start   a   new task with   a   new set   of   individuals),   but the skills you   will   develop   as you   engage   with, learn from, and support others will   be   invaluable   as you   progress   through   your   studies   and   beyond   Massey.   You will   be   not only focusing on course-specific   content through this assessment   but developing a   raft of other valuable   competencies.
To   help you   and your   peers   be successful   in your collaborative work,   remember to   implement   goodtime   management skills   (it   is   not just your deadline,   but a shared   deadline),focus on effective   interpersonal and communication skills   (verbal and   non-verbal),   and   recognise   and value the diversity each member   brings to the assessment task.   Remember, too, that taking the   time to get to   know your   new group or team   members   before   you   start the   actual   assessment         task will go along way to   realising the   benefits and   minimising   some   of the   challenges.
For students wishing to submit assessments intereo Māori and New Zealand Sign Language 
Massey   University   recognises the status of Te   Reo   Māori and   New   Zealand   Sign   Language
(NZSL) as officiallanguages of Aotearoa   New Zealand, and   particularly   recognises the   status   of   Te   Reo   Māori   as   aTaonga   with   respect   to   Te   Tiritio   Waitangi.
The   Massey   Business School supports the   right and opportunity of   any   students   who wish to   submit assessments   in Te   Reo   Māori and will seek to   equitably   support   students   who   use
NZSL.
It   is   preferred that students wishing to submit an assessment   in Te   Reo   Māori   alert the   relevant   teaching staff ahead of time. Permission is not required.   advance   notice that   an   assessment
will   be submitted   in Te   Reo will   be   helpful   in terms of   identifying   and   accessing the   specific   expertise   needed.
Assignment Extensions 
An   extension of time to complete an   assignment   may   be granted   at   the   discretion   of   the
course coordinator   in the case of   unforeseen   circumstances   such   as   misadventure   or   illness.            Applications for an extension   of time should   be   made to the course   coordinator   by email   or   in   person. You   maybe   required to substantiate your application with appropriate   documentary
evidence such as   medical certificates, accident   reports   etc.   (Please   note that   work
commitments,computer failures, or   lack of commitment from other   group   members   are   usually considered   insufficient grounds for an extension.)
Please   let your course or offering coordinator   know as   soon   as   possible   if   you   need   an   extension.   We want to assist,   but we   need to   hear from you.
Late Assignments 
We expect that you will work diligently to   manage   your workload   and   plan   assignment
preparation so you can submit   in a   timely   fashion.    This   is   part   of the   expectations   for
academic study.    However, we also   know that   unexpected   circumstances can   and   do   arise.
If you do   miss the deadline and you   did   not   ask for   an   extension, you   may   still   submit   your   assignment   late.   However, in usual circumstances*:
•                   A   penalty of   2   marks out of   100   per   day   (including weekends)   will   be   applied to   the final   mark.
•                   Assignments that are 8-14 days   late   may   receive   little,   if any, written feedback   and   may   not   be   returned within the three-week turnaround time.
If your assignment arrives 15+ days after the deadline, it will not be marked and you will receive a zero grade. 
* We   recognise that unusual circumstances   (including global pandemics) may cause   sudden


and   unexpected disruptions to study.    If such   unusual   circumstances   arise, your   Course
Coordinator will let you   know of any changes   in   expectations   around   late   submissions.    As   always,   please   let   us   know   of circumstances that   have affected you.
